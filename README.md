This project investigates the key drivers and patterns of supply chain disruptions using a quantitative, data-driven approach. 
Leveraging operational, historical, coordination, and severity-related variables, the analysis applies descriptive visualizations and inferential statistical techniques to identify factors that influence disruption occurrence, risk, and impact in the supply chain.
This project presents the empirical analysis conducted to examine the drivers, patterns, and outcomes of supply chain disruptions. Using a combination of linear regression models and supporting visualisations, the chapter evaluates how operational conditions, historical exposure, coordination mechanisms, and contextual factors influence both the likelihood and severity of supply chain disruptions.
## Objective
The main objective of this chapter is to provide quantitative evidence on whether observable supply chain characteristics can explain disruption risk and impact. The analysis is designed to move beyond descriptive insights by statistically testing relationships between key variables and disruption outcomes.
## Data and Analytical Approach
The analysis is based on a dataset of 999 observations, representing supply chain transactions and disruption events. Linear regression was consistently employed across the chapter to ensure methodological coherence. 
This approach allows for:
•	Estimation of the direction and magnitude of effects
•	Assessment of statistical significance
•	Comparison of explanatory power across different model specifications
• Where appropriate, visualisations (scatter plots, coefficient bar charts, and grouped bar charts) were used to complement regression outputs and enhance interpretability.
## Key Analytical Dimensions
The project evaluates disruption dynamics across four broad dimensions:
1.	Operational Factors
Variables such as delay days, lead time, quantity ordered, and historical disruption exposure were examined to determine their influence on disruption risk. Regression results and coefficient bar charts demonstrate that operational delays are the most consistent and statistically significant predictor of increased disruption risk, while other operational variables exhibit weaker or insignificant effects.
2.	Historical Exposure to Disruptions
The analysis investigates whether repeated past disruptions increase future vulnerability. Results show that historical disruption counts have limited explanatory power when considered in isolation, suggesting that past exposure alone does not automatically translate into higher future disruption probability or severity.
3.	Coordination and Governance Factors
Variables capturing coordination structures—such as dominant buyer presence and data-sharing consent—were assessed to understand their influence on disruption outcomes. While grouped bar charts indicate small observable differences in average disruption levels, regression results confirm that these differences are not statistically significant, implying that coordination mechanisms alone do not substantially mitigate or amplify disruption outcomes without strong operational foundations.
4.	Combined Risk Identification
A comprehensive multivariate model incorporating operational, historical, and coordination variables was estimated to identify high-risk supply chain situations. This model demonstrates strong explanatory power, with disruption severity and delay days emerging as the dominant predictors of overall risk. The findings indicate that high-risk situations are best identified through combinations of factors, rather than single indicators.
## Role of Visualisations
Visual tools are used strategically throughout the chapter to support regression findings:
•	Coefficient bar charts highlight the relative importance of predictors
•	Scatter plots with trendlines illustrate weak or strong linear relationships
•	Grouped bar charts compare average disruption outcomes across risk categories and coordination structures
These charts reinforce the statistical results rather than replacing them, ensuring alignment between visual and econometric evidence.
## Overall Contribution
This project provides robust empirical support for the argument that supply chain disruption risk is primarily operationally driven, with severity and delays playing a central role. Governance and historical factors, while intuitively important, show limited standalone explanatory power. The findings establish a strong quantitative foundation for the discussion and implications presented.
